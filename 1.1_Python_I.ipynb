    "### Overview\n",
    "Variable have a type. There are [numerous data types](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Data_Types) to store different types of things, such as integers or strings. A variable object may be of [mutable or immutable type](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Data_Types#Mutable_vs_Immutable_Objects). For example, arrays are mutable, their elements can be changed. (This can lead in practice to [unexpected results when using augmented assignments](https://gist.github.com/fherwig/48b3fc2a920833c6077891982ad122d7).) Tupples are immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computer needs to know if the content of a variable is a string, an integer or a float, for example. It will provide the appropriate machine representation. We will not get into details, but you can imagine that it takes, for example, more memory space to store a real number with many digits following the decimal point compared to an integer number of similar magnitude. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the most important data types for single things (these are immutable):\n",
    "\n",
    " Type | Comment | Example\n",
    "---|---|---\n",
    "integer | can be written without a fractional component | `i = 2`\n",
    "floats | real numbers, come in different precision, i.e. `float64` | `x = 2.1145`, `np.pi`\n",
    "complex | complex numbers, e.g. scipy.sqrt(-1) | `1j`\n",
    "strings | a sequence of characters | `name='Alfred'`\n",
    "\n",
    "And these are the most important types to combine many single things (most are mutable, individual elements of objects of this type can be changed).\n",
    "\n",
    " Type | Comment | Example\n",
    "------|---------|---------\n",
    "lists | a list of any combination of data types | `mylist = [1,np.pi,name,a,'Hello World!`]\n",
    "arrays | a numpy construct, vectors or higher dimenstional, contains numbers | `b=np.array(a,dtype='float64')`\n",
    "dictionary | elements given by key | `ages = {'Anna':25,'Frank':17,'Gandalf':107}`\n",
    "tuple | immutable(!) list of numbers | `a=(1,2,3)`\n",
    "\n",
