    "`ssh` stands for _secure shell_ and is a program that allows you to login to or visit a different, remote compute via the terminal. The ssh program is also used by various applications to facilitate authenticated exchange of information. To be _secure_ ssh uses encryption, and in order to facilitate that the user needs to setup a public and a private _key_. \n",

    "Data can often be compressed to save disk space. For example, imagine you have a large file that contains ~1000 times the number `0` and only a couple times the number `1`. You can imagine that there are ways to store that information that are more efficient than actually saving 1000 numbers. [Data compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression) is a whole topic in its own right. \n",

    "\n",
    "The `>` means that the output of the first command `ls -laRt /` is redirected into the file with the following name. The `ls` command-line options `-laRt` stand for long output, all files (including the otherwise hidden files starting with a dot), recursive, sorted by creation time. You can find detailed information about these and many other arguments in the `man` page. \n",

Find a tutorial, for example [this for emacs](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-emacs-editor-in-linux), [this one for vi](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-vi-editor.htm) or [this for nano](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/) (although nano is self-guided).

In any such team it would be important not only to share pieces of code and other information but to attribute it, and to document when and where work has been added and changes have been made. In this way the team can review changes to a previous version, find bugs and easily use and relate to previous versions. Another advantage is that everybody can make changes to their own copy and later merge the changes back to a common code base.

You will then have to `git checkout` the respective file, or you will have to `add/commit` the file so that it can then be merged with the version on the repository. In some cases the merge cannot be completed automatically, e.g. if the remote and the local commit have changed the same part of the file. In that case a manual resolution of the conflict is required. This is an advanced topic. "
