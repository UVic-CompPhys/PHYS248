    "### How to get and stay out of trouble\n",

    "Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge.\n",
    "Aborting\n",
    "```\n",
    "What has happened? Well, for a start - read the error message. Git is very good at providing useful messages. This situation happens when you have made changes to a tracked file that are not committed. Then git does not know how to merge them, but it also will not overwrite your changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "What can you do? Decide if you want to keep the changes, then add/commit. Or if you want to discard, then checkout the file, i.e. recreate it from the last commit with `git checkout filename`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then repeat the `git pull` command. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can avoid the problem by being deliberate in what you do in your repo and generally keep it clean. Make changes to a notebook and commit. Remove files that you do not want to track. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are _best practice_ solutions to all possible problems in git, such as undoing a commit, etc. For a beginner an easier, even if a bit more radical method to extract yourself is to copy untracked and/or uncommited files out of the repo, remove the repo, clone it again and copy the files in question back into the repo.
